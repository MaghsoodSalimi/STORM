## Introduction

Welcome to STORM!  
  
The repository highlights a project work and technical competencies across data engineering, cloud platforms, automation, and data visualization, illustrating relevant capabilities through an end-to-end data pipeline.  




---
## Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting, storing, and visualizing **Train Announcement** data from the Swedish Transport Administration’s public API. It demonstrates working with live data feeds, automating data ingestion, and creating meaningful reports.

Key objectives include:

- Extracting real-time train announcement data from Trafikverket’s API  
- Storing the data in a cloud database (Azure SQL)  
- Automating the data collection and ingestion process  
- Building a Power BI report to visualize train announcements effectively  

---

## Step 1: Data Extraction with Jupyter Notebook

The initial phase involves exploring and extracting train announcement data using a Jupyter Notebook (located in the `notebook` folder):

- Connection established with Trafikverket’s API ([https://data.trafikverket.se/](https://data.trafikverket.se/))  
- Queried and retrieved train announcement data in JSON/XML format  
- Parsed and transformed the data into structured tables  
- Exported the processed data as CSV files into the `data` folder for validation and further use  

This step helps in understanding the API structure and the details of train schedules, delays, and statuses.

---

## Step 2: Cloud Storage with Azure SQL Database

To ensure scalable and efficient storage, an **Azure SQL Database** is provisioned:

- A relational database schema is designed for train announcement data  
- Tables optimized for querying time-series and event data are created  
- Secure connections for data insertion and retrieval are established  
- Indexing is configured to improve query performance  

This serves as the central repository for train announcement records.

---

## Step 3: Automated Data Pipeline Using Azure Functions and Power Automate

To maintain continuously updated data, the ingestion process is fully automated:

- An **Azure Function** (implemented with PowerShell) periodically calls the Trafikverket API to fetch new data  
- The function processes and writes the data directly into the Azure SQL Database  
- **Microsoft Power Automate** is used to schedule and orchestrate the execution of the Azure Function on a recurring basis  

This setup ensures the database reflects the most recent train announcements without manual effort.

---

## Step 4: Data Visualization with Power BI

A Power BI report is created to provide insights into the train announcement data:

- Connected directly to the Azure SQL Database  
- Dashboards highlight train schedules, delays, and announcements  
- Filters and visual elements enable dynamic exploration  
- The report is shared to facilitate easy access and stakeholder engagement  

This visualization supports effective monitoring and analysis of train operations based on live data.
